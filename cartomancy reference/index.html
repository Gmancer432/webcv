  <h2 id="h-how-is-cartomancy-different-from-tarot"><strong>How Is Cartomancy Different From Tarot?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>Besides the deck, the main difference between cartomancy readings and tarot readings is that the cartomancy cards have a more clear cut meaning. Tarot cards like The Devil or The High Priestess can have <a
      href="https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/how-to-read-bad-tarot-cards-positively">hidden meanings</a>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cartomancy readings are great for giving literal questions to answers. Tarot tends to show potential outcomes. One isn’t better than the other, the choice is just preference in how you like getting answers.&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 id="h-cartomancy-card-layouts-interpretations"><strong>Cartomancy Card Layouts &amp; Interpretations&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>In cartomancy, each number, suit, and face card have a specific meaning (however, the Joker card is not always used.)&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example, the Ace of Hearts represents a new beginning, such as a new relationship or job opportunity and the 7 of Spades means the loss of a friend or another significant person in your life due to a disagreement or problem.</p>
  <p>The most popular method of cartomancy technique is the Wheel of Fortune. The reader randomly removes cards and interprets meaning based on the pick order.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 id="h-card-layouts"><strong>Card Layouts</strong></h3>
  <p>Many spreads are used in cartomancy, ranging from a single card reading to 21-card spreads. Usually, spreads are multiples of 3 (typically 3, 9, or 21), so three sections can represent past, present, and future. Depending on the size of the
    layout, cartomancy can provide you with a quick answer or deep life insight.</p>
  <h3 id="h-card-interpretations"><strong>Card Interpretations</strong></h3>
  <p>Cartomancy readings depend on the suit and value of the revealed card. The suit depicts the broader meaning or life category of a card. Face cards are people in your life. Number cards are life events in your near future.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is a list of what each card in a standard 52-card deck means in a cartomancy reading.</p>
